1. How to use Counter in Python

Ex: 
Desciption:
    ransomNote = "a"

Code:
    st1, st2 = Counter(ransomNote), Counter(magazine)
    print(st1) 

[Output] Counter({u'a': 1})

2. What is "&"?

Ex:

  a, b = 9, 10
print(a & b)  # line 1
print(a and b)  # line 2

[Output] 8
[Output] 10

In line 1, a = 1001, b = 1010, matching a and b, gives us 1000 which is the binary value of decimal value 8
The value of b is returned because it is the last value where checking ends for the truthfulness of the statement
